Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be 
educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun. 
Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge 
that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of 
your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this
